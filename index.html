    <h1>Cassandra Carlos</h1>
    <h2>Website Designer and Developer @ Simple Geometry</h2>
    <p>I design and build functional websites under my freelance studio, Simple Geometry. My approach focuses on clarity, usability, and efficiency. I use core web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and make sites that are easy to navigate and communicate their message without unnecessary complexity.<br>Before moving into web design, I worked as an illustrator. That background still influences how I think about layout and visual structure. I’m hands-on with tools like GitHub and Google Analytics and prioritize design decisions that serve the purpose of the site.<br>I also enjoy drawing and video games, both of which keep me creatively engaged.</p>
