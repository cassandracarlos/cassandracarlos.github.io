Pocket Towns - Asset Guide

1. Pixel Art Size & Workflow

Work in 16x16 as the base size, then upscale to 32x32 and 48x48.

Keep details clean and readable at all sizes.

2. Color Palette

Use a limited palette (e.g., DawnBringer 32 or similar) for a cohesive, warm, and inviting look.

3. Perspective & Style

Top-down perspective with a slight tilt for depth.

Inspired by NDS-era Pokémon towns—cozy but lively.

Balances small-town charm with urban energy, similar to Sixth Street in New Eridu, a vibrant district known for its mix of small shops, street vendors, nightlife, and bustling pedestrian-friendly streets.
