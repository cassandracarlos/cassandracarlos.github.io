That sounds awesome! Let's break it down step by step. A city-themed pixel art asset pack (top-down) should include a mix of environment pieces, buildings, props, roads, vehicles, and characters. Here’s a structured plan:

1. Tile Size & Style
Tile Size: 16x16, 32x32, or 48x48 pixels? (Choose based on your target resolution)
Color Palette: Limited palette (e.g., DawnBringer 32) or custom?
Perspective: Standard top-down or a slight angle (e.g., 3/4 view)?
2. Categories & Assets
A. Terrain & Ground Tiles
Asphalt roads (straight, curves, intersections, crosswalks)
Sidewalks (clean, cracked, patterned)
Grass patches, dirt, pavement variations
